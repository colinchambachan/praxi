# Praxi
### AI-Powered Language Learning for the 21st century.

Praxi is a tool intended to solve what current language learning platforms often lack - conversation. Praxi not only offers chatting ability with native speakers of a variety of languages, but also on-demand conversation with an AI chat bot to hone your skills.

Created for DeltaHacks X, McMaster's annual hackathon for change. Developed on January 13-14, 2024.
